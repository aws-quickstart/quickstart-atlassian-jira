## Jira Software and Jira Service Desk Data Center on the AWS Cloud

Use this Quick Start to deploy one of the following Jira products from Atlassian on the AWS Cloud:

* Jira Software Data Center
* Jira Service Desk Data Center

This Quick Start uses the [Atlassian Standard Infrastructure (ASI)](https://fwd.aws/xYyYy) as a foundation. You can choose to build a new ASI for your deployment or deploy Jira into your existing ASI. You can also deploy Bitbucket Data Center and Confluence Data Center within the same ASI.

For architectural details, best practices, step-by-step instructions, and customization options, see the 
[deployment guide](https://fwd.aws/Wz3Qb).

### Network prerequisites

You need to create the required AWS networking infrastructure
(VPC, subnets) by using the [ASI Quick Start](https://fwd.aws/xYyYy), or by deploying Jira with a new ASI.
For details, see the [deployment guide](https://fwd.aws/Wz3Qb).
