== Postdeployment steps

The following procedure helps you set up your new {partner-product-short-name} deployment.

. Choose the URL that is displayed in the *Outputs* tab of the AWS CloudFormation stack to go to the {partner-product-short-name} configuration page.
+
IMPORTANT: If you get an https://confluence.atlassian.com/kb/network-and-connectivity-troubleshooting-guide-720405335.html[HTTP Error 503] response when you access the URL, it means that {partner-product-short-name} is still loading. This is expected, and you should wait a couple of minutes before trying again.
. On the *Setup application properties* page, enter a title for your Jira application deployment, choose the *Mode* you want, leave the base URL unchanged, and then choose *Next*.

. To set up the Jira application, you need to create an Administrator account and password. The Administrator account has full access to all data in Jira, so we highly recommend that you choose a strong password for this account. Enter the Administrator’s user details in the setup screen (Figure 5), and then choose *Next*.
