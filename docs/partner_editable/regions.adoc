The services offered in each region change from time to time. If your preferred region isn't on this list, check the https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/[Regional Product Services] table to see if it already supports EFS.

[WARNING]

Even though you can deploy our Data Center products on https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/[AWS GovCloud], we don’t test or verify our AWS Quick Starts on the AWS GovCloud environment and can’t provide any support.
