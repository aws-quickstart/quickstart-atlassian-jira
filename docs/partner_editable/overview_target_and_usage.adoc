This Quick Start is for users who want to deploy {partner-product-name} in a supported configuration in the AWS Cloud, following AWS and Atlassian best practices.

This Quick Start uses the https://fwd.aws/xYyYy[Atlassian Standard Infrastructure] (ASI) as a foundation. You can choose to build a new ASI for your deployment or deploy {partner-product-short-name} into your existing ASI. You can also deploy Confluence, Bitbucket, and Crowd Data Center within the same ASI.
